What is feature Enginering?

Feature engineering is the process of transforming raw data into features that are suitable for machine learning models. 
In other words, it is the process of selecting, extracting, and transforming the most relevant features from the available data to build more accurate and efficient machine learning models.


Three mechanism of feature engineering:

1. Missing Completely at random (MCAR)
2. Missing at random (MCR)
3. Missing data not at random (MNAR)
